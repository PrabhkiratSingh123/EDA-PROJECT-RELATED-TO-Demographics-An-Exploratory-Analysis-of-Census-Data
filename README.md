## ðŸ“Š Demographics: An Exploratory Analysis of Census Data  

**Project Semester:** Januaryâ€“April 2025  
**Course Code:** INT375  
**Program & Section:** B.Tech (CSE) - K23GD  
**Submitted By:** Prabhkirat Singh (Reg. No: 12309872)  
**Guided By:** Mrs. Baljinder Kaur, Discipline of CSE/IT, Lovely Professional University  



## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview

This project conducts an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of the Indian Census dataset to uncover insights about the population based on factors such as:

- Gender distribution
- Urban vs. Rural residence
- Place of birth
- Age groups
- Correlation between demographic variables

The findings are visualized using Python libraries including **Pandas**, **Seaborn**, **Matplotlib**, and **NumPy**.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset Source

The dataset is sourced from the [Government of India's Census Portal](https://censusindia.gov.in/nada/index.php/catalog/10717) and contains the following key features:

- State, District, Area Name
- Age Group
- Birthplace
- Total / Male / Female population
- Rural and Urban segmentation

---

## ðŸ”§ EDA Process

The following steps were performed:

- **Data Cleaning:** Handling nulls, fixing inconsistent entries
- **Transformation:** Filtering, type conversions
- **Aggregation:** Using `groupby()` and `sum()`
- **Visualization:** Pie, bar, line, violin, and heatmap plots

### ðŸ›  Libraries Used

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `squarify`

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Analyses & Visualizations

### 1. Gender Distribution
- **Insight:** Slight male dominance, otherwise balanced
- **Visualization:** Donut chart

### 2. Urban vs Rural
- **Insight:** Rural population still forms the majority
- **Visualization:** Bar and pie charts

### 3. Top Birthplaces
- **Insight:** Majority born locally; UP leads in external migration
- **Visualization:** Treemap

### 4. Age Group Distribution
- **Insight:** Peak in working-age population; decline in senior groups
- **Visualization:** Line plot

### 5. Correlation Matrix
- **Insight:** Strong positive correlation between related variables
- **Visualization:** Heatmap

### 6. Population by Birthplace
- **Insight:** Uneven contribution by regions; some have higher spread
- **Visualization:** Violin plot

## âœ… Conclusion

The project highlighted:

- Significant urban-rural population contrasts  
- Balanced but slightly male-skewed gender ratios  
- Insightful birthplace patterns suggesting internal migration  
- Dominance of the working-age population

EDA proves to be a powerful step in making census data actionable for policy-making.

## ðŸš€ Future Scope

- Predictive Modeling for migration/urban growth
- Geo-mapping with tools like `GeoPandas`
- Interactive Dashboards (Plotly/Tableau)
- Time-series forecasting on census trends
- Machine Learning for clustering and classification
